			<h2>Documentation</h2>
			<p>I currently work as a tech writer at Atlassian, on the Confluence design team. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of my purview is not writing documentation. What I actually do can be best summarised as 'making our software easier to understand.'</p>
			<p>I'm intimately involved in the design process, participate in user testing, and work with a designer and product manager to refine flows. I know our customers well - I read feedback, participate in forums, etc so that I can adequately understand their needs and what they struggle with. And I know the product, so I can write about it.</p>

					<a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/organize-your-space-827106212.html" target="_blank">

			<h2>Articles</h2>
			<p>Back when I was younger I did a lot of writing about music, arts, and events for publications like Purple Sneakers and Faster Louder.</p>
			<p>I spent a decent amount of time as a sub-editor at Purple Sneakers as well, which involved both doing a lot of very fast turnaround writing, and editing a tonne of stuff that other people had written.</p>
			<p>I got incredibly familiar with Wordpress and SEO doing that.</p>

			<h2>Random other things I've written</h2>
				<p>I occassionally wrote a few pieces for university magazines or to submit into competitions.</p>
			 	<p>I once won first, second, and third prize in the Dorothea Mackellar poetry competition. No, I was not the only entrant.</p>
				<p>I have also on a few separate occassions writen into magazines and won letter of the month.</p> 
				<p>I stopped once I realised that if you don't like the prize, it's a pain to dispose of thoughtfully. Also that you actually had to read magazines.</p>
